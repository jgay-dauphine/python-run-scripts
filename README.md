# python-run-scripts
Some python scripts that run other scripts. The main idae here is to have some game implemented and then AI developped to play the game. The AI can be simple or as complex as you'd like.

I used this *humm* framework in my python class to make students compete in logic and simple game AI dev.

## simple_core
A simple demonstration of what needed to be achieve

## PFC
A Rock - Paper - Scisor game. Two AI can be run for this game.

## Bataille Navale
A Battleship implementation that runs 2 AI to see wich one is the "best". Used in Python class to make a tournament for AI coded by students.
